<h3>
    Here is a little about me :)
</h3>

<p> My family is from New Orleans, but I was born in Boston, and have lived in Bethesda, MD and Tulsa, Oklahoma. I love french fries more than anything, and I love my pet elephant. I have been to Canada, Spain, and Germany. I want to hike really tall mountains and swim in all the oceans of the world. My favorite foods are my moms New Orleans dishes, like red beans and rice, or shrimp etouffee.  </p>
<ul> I like to:
    <li>Play soccer!</li>
    <li>Draw and paint!</li>
    <li>Listen to rap, soul, and rock music!</li>
    <li>Travel the world...</li>
</ul>

<div> Here is a link to a picture of my pet elephant (who I love with all my heart):
